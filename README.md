quadrilaterals
==============
Quadrilaterals v1
A quadrilateral is any four-sided shape. A rectangle, square, rhombus, and trapezoid are all types of quadrilaterals.
A square is a type of rectangle. A rhombus is a type of trapezoid. Model this concept in Ruby using classes and inheritance.
Use TDD to confirm that all of your classes are working correctly.

Quadrilaterals v2
Revisit your Quadrilateral object hierarchy. Add a way to:
Calculate the perimeter of every shape.
Calculate the area of shapes with right angles: rectangles and squares.
Get the length of a single side of equilaterals: squares and rhombi.
Use TDD to confirm that all of your classes are working correctly.
